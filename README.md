# realm-tracker-extended
Adds active player counts to Realm Royale Tracker's existing service.

Because bots have taken over a lot of games, it can be useful to know the number of players that were actually in the game you are looking up. This information is added next to the match type in the post-game match view.

# Install
Currently the application is only supported by firefox and can be installed by the following [link](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/realm-tracker-extended/)

# In Progress
